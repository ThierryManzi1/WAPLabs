<h1>State Management Quiz</h1>
<p>1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems? </p>

 <p>-No, post requests can not bookmarked because  in the post method the data is passed in the HTTP request body.</p>

<p>2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?</p>
<p>-defines an object which can dispatch the request to any resources on the server. Thus forward or include the response of a resource in a Servlet.</p>

<p>3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?</p>
<p>-A redirect in a servlet is letting the browser do the work through relative and absolute url redirects , thus the client  
while a request dispactch in a servlet is having something else on the server side
do the work. Thus in redirect the client notices a change in the URL but in a request dispatch the client does not see any changes in the url</p>

<p>4. What is an attribute ?</p>
<p>-It is a name/value pair(where the name is a String and Value is an object) in a map instance variable.</p>

<p>5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters?</p>
<p>-Parameters ar read only while attributes are read/write objects. </p>
<p>-Parameters return Strings  while attributes are objects of any type but need to be casted .</p>


<p>6. What are dangers of using attributes?</p>
<p>Shared by every servlet and every request in the application</p>
<p>Like nuclear power ,very powerful , have to be careful</p>
<p>• Not thread safe</p>
<p>• Nor session attributes</p>
<p>• Only request attributes thread safe</p>


<p>7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.</p>
<p>-For Http to be stateless it means that Http does not remember/ retain session information  from which client a request comes after it has delivered a response.
-Example of stateful protocol is File transfer protocol (FTP)</p>

<p>8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
method).</p>
<p>-Session Atrributes</p>
<p>-Context Atrribute</p>
<p>-Request Attribute</p>
<p>-Hidden Fields on a form</p>
<p>-Cookies</p>

<p>9. How long does a session last?
-By default, a session lasts until there's 30 minutes of inactivity, but you can adjust this limit so a session lasts from a few seconds to several hours .</p>

<p>10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?</p>
<p>-Session cookies disappear once the user closes the browser window. All permanent cookies have an expiration date written in their code.</p>
<p>11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?</p>

<p>-URL writing is a process of appending or modifying any url structure while loading a page. The request made by client is always a new request and the server 
can not identify whether the current request is send by a new client or the previous same client. It is normally done when clients disable cookies </p>

<p>12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?</p>
<p>-This is because http is stateless protocol and there is no session set to hold the value of the request  </p>
